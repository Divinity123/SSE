In the future, we plan to apply our security notion to analyse security of constructions in the literature and our own. We will try to understand how leakage and prior knowledge affects security of schemes. In particular, we are interested in padding and how they affect efficiency and security. In addition to this line of work, we are interested in attacks on SSE schemes.
