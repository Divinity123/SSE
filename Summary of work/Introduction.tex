This document is a summary of work so far on defining security notion for searchable encryptions and finding good/bad constructions with respect to the notions. In particular, we have considered using idea of g-leakage to measure security of a given scheme with respect to a target (gain) function and shown it is equivalent to an experiment-based adversary. We have studied three schemes we proposed, and shown that even though all of the schemes are secure against keyword guessing attack, they are not equally secure against other types of attacks. This demonstrates that security against keyword guessing attack is not sufficient for an encryptions scheme to be secure. For instance, one of the scheme we proposed is secure against inference attack but it leaks all keywords in all documents information-theoretically.
